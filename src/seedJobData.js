  description: "<h3>About Triplebyte</h3>\n<p>Triplebyte is transforming the way software engineers are hired. Our mission is to build an open, valuable and skills-based credential for all engineers. This is important because millions of people have skills (and deserve good jobs), but don’t fit the profile that recruiters seek. Another way of saying this is that talent is uniformly distributed, but opportunity is not. Our goal is to broaden the distribution of opportunity."
